# 3D-Renderer
This is a simple 3D rendering engine that I am working on in Java.

## What Will There Be?
I will eventually be able to draw a sphere in 3D on the screen and includes slides so that you can rotate the on each axis. 
Eventually, I hope to be able to build off of this for more projects, though as of right now that will be far in the future.


## Credit
I am following a [tutorial](http://blog.rogach.org/2015/08/how-to-create-your-own-simple-3d-render.html) for the baseline of this renderer.
