# 3D-Renderer
This is a simple 3D rendering engine that I am working on in Java.

## Waht is here?
This is just a simple program to draw a sphere in 3D on the screen that includes sliders so that the user can rotate the sphere on each axis.
Eventually, I hope to be able to build off of this for more projects, though have not followed up on this yet because I have been at university.

## Credit
I am following a [tutorial](http://blog.rogach.org/2015/08/how-to-create-your-own-simple-3d-render.html) for the baseline of this renderer.
